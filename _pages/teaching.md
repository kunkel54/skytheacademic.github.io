### Independent Instructor

*POL 237 - Modern Weapons and International Relations, Summer 2021/22 (Online)*
See the bottom of this page for one of my many videos for POL-237.
Various reviews from anonymous course reviews regarding this course:

"Great communication and fair, clear feedback on assignments"
"Loved this class, Prof. Kunkel was a great instructor, I especially loved the format of the class and transparency from the start about what to expect. I hope he continues to lay out and stick to a schedule in the syllabus so well, it made it very easy to succeed as a student"
"Adam has done a great job with organizing this course. I found the videos extremely informative and easy to follow, yet also containing key information. I also appreciated that there was more than one medium to get the information from, be it audio recordings, videos (which I preferred), or the script from that week. I would hope that he continues to do everything he has already done, and that you guys give him a raise, because he deserves it"
