About
======
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, studying international relations (IR) with a minor in political methodology. My research broadly focuses on the intersection of security and non-state actors. My security research often focuses on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping and evaluating how, when, and where peacekeepers effectively protect civilians. For example, my dissertation, *The Local Effects of UN Peacekeeping*, examines the effects peacekeepers have on saving civilian lives and preventing violence against civilians with advanced quantitative methods at the most granular level used in the peacekeeping effectiveness literature.

As a Research Affiliate at the [Gender and Security Studies](https://www.sabrinamkarim.com/gsslab) (GSS) Lab at Cornell University, I am passionate about conducting research that addresses important questions about gender and security. The GSS Lab focuses on researching the barriers to women's participation in the security forces, including peacekeeping missions, and how gender shapes security force personnel's beliefs about violence. Using various methods such as survey data, institutional questionnaires, and elite interviews, we aim to understand the differences between military and police personnel's beliefs about gender, violence, abuse of authority, and security force autonomy.

My research on non-state security actors includes a focus on Russia's Wagner Group. In research on the Wagner Group, my coauthor [Matthew Kyle Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-ellis-7b187492/) and I conceptualize them as a quasi-private military contractor (QPMC) that maintains ties to the state while utilizing the identity of traditional PMCs. In [this](https://www.skytheacademic.com/files/violence_as_a_condition.pdf) paper, we examine the group's operations within the Central African Republic and explore why QPMCs like the Wagner Group commit substantially more lethal political violence than the state actors who employ them. To test this theory empirically, we use the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as an instrument to deal with endogeneity. This research aims to expand our understanding of how QPMCs operate and the implications of their actions for international security. We are excited to contribute to this area of research and to collaborate with other scholars interested in understanding the complex dynamics of non-state security actors.

I am always open to collaborative research projects and am currently working on several projects with other graduate students and professors. In research with another graduate student [Mitushi Mukherjee](https://twitter.com/Mitushi_Mukh), we highlight the problematic nature of the racial origins of the phrase "sub-Saharan Africa" and how it can lead to incorrect conclusions when used as a catch-all term. We find that political scientists should avoid making overly-generalizable conclusions and find alternative approaches to avoid perpetuating the racist connotations associated with such generalizations. I'm also working on a peacekeeping project with professors [Zach Warner](https://zachwarner.net/) and [Doug Atkinson](https://dougbatkinson.wordpress.com/), examining when violence fills the vacuum left when peacekeepers depart. Finally, I'm working on a research project with [Catalina Vega-MÃ©ndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalina-vega-mendez-9947a01b9/), where we investigate how peacekeepers act as institutional actors to increase trust in the state.

Commitment to DEI
======
As a passionate advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia, I am committed to creating an inclusive, equitable, and enriching community for all. My experiences growing up in poverty as a transgender, queer, first-generation student have motivated me to uplift underrepresented voices in my academic work and community engagement. I have made intentional efforts to co-author with and mentor graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds and tutor at Purdue's LGBTQ center, providing valuable knowledge, insights, and engagement to LGBTQ+ undergraduates. I am also a co-founder and the inaugural president of Indiana's first student association for LGBTQ+ graduate students.

Moreover, my research agenda includes bringing issues to the forefront of political science, such as the dangers of using the phrase "sub-Saharan Africa" and its racist origins. I am also organizing a workshop for Peace Science to provide early-career scholars who identify as LGBTQ+ with mentorship, guidance, and a network of experienced academics. As an educator, I promote DEI in the classroom by taking an inclusive approach to designing and delivering course materials, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to engage fully with the course material and succeed academically. Ultimately, I aim to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic community that fosters excellence in scholarship, teaching, and service.

Short Biography
======
Before starting my Ph.D. program at Purdue, I received my BA from Purdue in 2019. I grew up in Indianapolis, IN, and started my undergraduate studies in 2015 in political science. I initially started grad school to advance my expertise in IR to a Master's level. However, collaborations with fellow graduate students and professors alongside rigorous training in methodology fostered an affinity for all things research, leading me to pursue academia as a career. I am a first-gen queer scholar seeking to improve the lives and experiences of those marginalized by academia and the broader world, especially minority and first-gen grad students who often face barriers invisible to others.

If you are interested in talking to me, please feel free to contact me on any of the platforms listed on the left side of this page or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://koalendar.com/e/meet-with-sky/).

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
