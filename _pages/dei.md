As a passionate advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia, I am committed to creating an inclusive, equitable, and enriching community for all. My experiences growing up in poverty as a transgender, queer, first-generation student have motivated me to uplift underrepresented voices in my academic work and community engagement. I have made intentional efforts to co-author with and mentor graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds and tutor at Purdue's LGBTQ center, providing valuable knowledge, insights, and engagement to LGBTQ+ undergraduates. I am also a co-founder and the inaugural president of Indiana's first student association for LGBTQ+ graduate students.

Moreover, my research agenda includes bringing issues to the forefront of political science, such as the dangers of using the phrase "sub-Saharan Africa" and its racist origins. I am also organizing a workshop for Peace Science to provide early-career scholars who identify as LGBTQ+ with mentorship, guidance, and a network of experienced academics. As an educator, I promote DEI in the classroom by taking an inclusive approach to designing and delivering course materials, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to engage fully with the course material and succeed academically. Ultimately, I aim to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic community that fosters excellence in scholarship, teaching, and service.
